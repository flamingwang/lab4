# EXERCISE 1: What method you used to make your peer download and upload
#    files in parallel?  (~1-3 sentences)

# EXERCISE 2A: What conditions did you find and fix that would have
#    triggered a buffer overrun bug?  (~1-3 sentences each)

Where there was an strcpy we used strncpy so that the characters could be
limited to FILENAMESIZ.  If the file name size is greater than filenamesiz,
then an error is outputted.  We also null-terminated the string.


# EXERCISE 2B: What other robustness problems did you fix?  (~1-3 sentences
#    each)

Check the size of the file and if the file is too big then return an error.

Checked if requested directory is current directory.

Checked the requested and current directory are valid - that they exist
and path length is less than PATH_MAX.

Made TASKBUFSIZ larger to work with many peers.

# Add any other information you'd like us to know below this line.
